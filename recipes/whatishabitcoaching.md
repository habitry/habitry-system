##Quick Summary
Habit-based coaching is a philosophy of communication and programming with the goal of facilitating permanent, sustainable behavior change for clients.

###How to Start

There has been a lot written on habits, behavior change, and client communication styles, but the foundational principles are:

__1. Clients basically know what to do; they just can’t make themselves do it.__ Habit-based coaching is not a replacement for quality coaching advice, but rather an expansion of the “coaches’ toolkit” to include communication and programming techniques that facilitate client motivation.

__2. Meet people where they’re at.__ In order to facilitate change, we must go to the Client’s Point A and help them find a path away from it.

__3. In the long run, habit trumps will.__ We strive to help our clients create the conditions (environmental, social, and psychological) that maximize the probability of success. Habit-based coaches are primarily concerned with the answer to the question, “but will you actually do it?”

__4. Know your scope.__ A carpenter and a orthopedic surgeon do not have the same job, even though they use similar tools. Similarly, a coach is not a therapist or a psychologist.

###What Other Coaches Are Doing

Coach Stevo, Omar Ganai, Georgie Fear, Roland Fisher, Sean Flanagan, Josh Hillis, Spencer Nadolsky, Jennifer Campbell, Annie Brees, Lauren Koski, and many others in the Motivate Forum work in groups, both online and in person, to help people focus on changing one habit at a time, together. Many others use habit-centered approaches one-on-one for nutrition and lifestyle behavior. Coach Stevo and Spencer Nadolsky use habit-centered approaches for Strength Training. James Clear uses them for productivity.

###Top Tips from the Motivate Collective

* “We only track one habit at a time.” – Coach Stevo

* “You didn’t fall off the wagon. THERE IS NO WAGON. No track, no road, you’re not “out of the groove” or “off the rails”, “up a creek” or any other metaphor we use to say we’re struggling. You’re where we ALL ARE: living a real life, that comes complete with easier time and harder times. That’s where you have always been and where you always will be.” – Georgie Fear

* “There is no ‘after.'” – Josh Hillis
