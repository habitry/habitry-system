##Quick Summary
Habit-based coaching is a philosophy of communication and programming with the goal of facilitating permanent, sustainable behavior change for clients.

###How to Start

There has been a lot written on habits, behavior change, and client communication styles, but the foundational principles are:

__1. Clients basically know what to do; they just can’t make themselves do it.__ Habit-based coaching is not a replacement for quality coaching advice, but rather an expansion of the “coaches’ toolkit” to include communication and programming techniques that facilitate client motivation.

__2. Meet people where they’re at.__ In order to facilitate change, we must go to the Client’s Point A and help them find a path away from it.

__3. In the long run, habit trumps will.__ We strive to help our clients create the conditions (environmental, social, and psychological) that maximize the probability of success. Habit-based coaches are primarily concerned with the answer to the question, “but will you actually do it?”

__4. Know your scope.__ A carpenter and a orthopedic surgeon do not have the same job, even though they use similar tools. Similarly, a coach is not a therapist or a psychologist.
