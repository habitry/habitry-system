#Motivational Interviewing
Motivational Interviewing is a way of having conversations with clients about change. By getting clients to talk about why they might want to change, we can help strengthen their motivation to change.

##Why it's important for Habitry

You can think of Habitry as group conversations about 4 things:

###1. Autonomy

Talking with clients about what they want to change and why.

###2. Competence

Talking with clients about how they are effective at getting what they want.

###3. Belonging

Talking with clients about how getting what they want will bring them closer to people they care about.

###4. Process: 

Talking with clients about how to keep moving forward, despite all the ups and down they'll encounter.
