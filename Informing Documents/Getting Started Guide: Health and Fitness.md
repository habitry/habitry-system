##Welcome

We’re stoked you’ve decided to become a Habitry Pro! If you're anything like us, you became a coach to help people make real and permanent changes in their life. But let's be honest: coaching is hard. That’s why we created the Habitry Coaching Platform. To make coaching easier for coaches, and better for clients. If there’s one way to sum up the philosophy behind the world’s best coaching platform, it's this:

####**Habits** are hard. **We** make them easy.

Habits are hard because people try to build them alone. Habitry is a solution for building new habits by building them together. The Habitry Coaching Platform is designed using best practices from psychological science. And everything we've learned in the trenches by coaching thousands of clients, with dozens of coaches, over the past 5+ years. All in a beautiful, easy-to-use package. The result? You can help more clients become the best version of themselves, with less work. And clients feel like all the momentum in the world is on their side. 

In this short guide, we’ll show you the exact steps you can follow coach your Habitry Group through their first habit, and beyond. 

We can’t wait to see you create lasting change for your clients.

##The Habitry Method: Big Picture View

There are three simple steps to the Habitry Method:

1. Pick a habit to work on, together.
2. Do it, together.
3. Talk about it, together.

That’s the big picture. We’ll walk you through the details in a bit. But first, let’s get your group ready so you can invite clients. 

##Preparing to Coach Your First Habit

Before we invite clients into your group, you’ll want to take care of two things:

1. Get clients excited about Habitry and preview what they can expect (We’ll show how).
2. Load the habit (at minimum, 48 hours before your group start date).

Okay, let’s go through each of those steps now.

###1. Get clients excited about Habitry

Getting clients excited about Habitry is easy. We’ll use two messages. I explain what they are below. After the explanation, you’ll find a template for each message that you can use. You can deliver these messages in-person, email, text, or whatever medium you feel is appropriate. The templates are formatted for emails. 

The first message is to be sent right after they sign-up. The purpose of the message is to induct them into the group, to build their anticipation by giving them a preview of what the group will be like, and to tell them how a Habitry Group is better and different from other types of coaching groups. Usually, you’ll give this message the workweek before your group start date, assuming your group starts on a Monday. 

Here is an template you can use:
