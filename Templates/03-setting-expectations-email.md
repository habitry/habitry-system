##Email #2: Setting Expectations

SUBJECT: (Insert Name of Habitry Coaching Group. E.g., Rockstar Fatloss Coaching Group) Begins Monday!

Hey (Insert Group Identity Label. E.g., Fatloss Rockstar)!

On Sunday, I will send out an email inviting you to the Facebook group where all the magic will happen. 

But before we get started, I wanted to go over what you can expect from (Insert Name of Habitry Coaching Group. E.g., Rockstar Fatloss Coaching Group) and you should NOT expect:

The (Insert Name of Habitry Coaching Group. E.g., Rockstar Fatloss Coaching Group) is not a “rapid fat loss” or meal-based program. We’ll be working on one habit at a time, which you’ll master with all the other (Insert Group Identity Label. E.g., Fatloss Rockstars). The community is where all the magic happens. It’s where you’ll get the most experience learning about how to actually integrate these habits into your life. And where you’ll be meeting the other (Insert Group Identity Label. E.g., Fatloss Rockstars) on the same journey as you.

As promised, the (Insert Name of Habitry Coaching Group. E.g., Rockstar Fatloss Coaching Group) will be unlike any fat loss program out there. As (Insert Group Identity Label. E.g., Fatloss Rockstars), you can expect unlimited and unconditional support from me. So never hesitate to reach out!
