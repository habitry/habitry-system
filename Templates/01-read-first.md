## Templates for lauching and running a Habitry Coaching Group.
### Emails

Habitry Coaches have helped 500+ online clients using the Habitry System.

Successful Habitry Group launches tend to have some specific emails sent to clients in the week leading up to the launch. If writing that many emails seems a little daunting, don’t worry. We’ll show you exactly what to write in each email and provide examples so you can set your clients up for maximum success!

**NOTE:** Like everything else in the Habitry System, the templates below are just suggestions. You may want to do things differently, and that’s totally cool with us! In fact, we’d love for you to share it with us in the Motivate Collective: http://habitry.com/collective.

With that out of the way, the suggested three emails are:

#### Email #1: Welcome ###
A “Welcome” email, sent when they sign-up, to get them excited about officially being in the group. In this email you’ll also provide them an opportunity to shape the group right off the bat by showing them how to invite a friend. 

**Template:** https://github.com/habitry/habitry-system/blob/master/Templates/02-welcome-email.md

#### Email #2: Setting Expectations ###
A “Setting Expectations” email, sent on the Friday before your group starts (assuming it starts on a Monday), to let your clients know what to expect and what not to expect in their Habitry group. 

**Template:** https://github.com/habitry/habitry-system/blob/master/Templates/03-setting-expectations-email.md

#### Email #3: Community Introduction ###
A “Community Introduction” email, sent on Sunday before your group starts (assuming it starts on a Monday), to show your clients how they can  can introduce themselves to the rest of their group.

**Template:** https://github.com/habitry/habitry-system/blob/master/Templates/04-community-introduction.md

#### Email #4: The Habit ###
This explains the habit the group will be working on, why it's important, how to scale it to each individual client's confidence level, and what to use as a piggbyback habit.

**Template:** https://github.com/habitry/habitry-system/blob/master/Templates/05-announcing-teams.md

### Communication Platform Posts

Below we've provided templates for posts to the communications platform you're using (like the Habitry platform or facebook groups).

#### Post #1: Icebreakers ###
These are useful for helping your community members get comfortable and talking right on Day 1.

#### Post #2: Announcing Teams ###
Assuming you have enough people in your group, this post announces teams to clients and explains why they are useful to them.

**Template:** https://github.com/habitry/habitry-system/blob/master/Templates/07-announcing-teams.md

#### Post #3: Individual Weekly Feedback ###
A weekly message to each client reviewing how did they did in the past week. Used to keep them moving forward and provides an opportunity to ask for support.
