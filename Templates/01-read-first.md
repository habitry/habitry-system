Habitry Coaches have helped 500+ online clients using the Habitry System.

Successful Habitry Group launches tend to have three specific emails sent to clients in the week leading up to the launch. If writing that many emails seems a little daunting, don’t worry. We’ll show you exactly what to write in each email and provide examples so you can set your clients up for maximum success!

Note: Like everything else in the Habitry System, these emails are simply suggestions. You may want to do things differently, and that’s totally cool with us! In fact, we’d love for you to share it with us in the Motivate Collective: http://habitry.com/collective.

With that out of the way, the suggested three emails are:

A “Welcome” email, sent when they sign-up, to get them excited about officially being in the group. In this email you’ll also provide them an opportunity to shape the group right off the bat by showing them how to invite a friend. See: 

A “Setting Expectations” email, sent on Friday, to let your clients know what to expect and what not to expect in their Habitry group. 

A “Community Introduction” email, sent on Sunday, to show your clients how they can  can introduce themselves to the rest of their group.
