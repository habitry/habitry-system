The Habit: I Will Track What I Eat

Why Do I Want To Do This Habit?

Getting a really good picture of what you’re eating now, day to day, is going to be a great starting place for what we do. The most important step in change is to create awareness. 

So we start with tracking protein! As crazy as it sounds, at this point, we don’t even care that you change how much protein you eat. 

How Can I Make This Habit Easy?

One of the most important things for you to succeed in the CMFIT Legends Nutrition Group is custom tailoring each habit to you.

For this habit, and every other habit that you’ll do, we’ll do that by asking you to fill in the blanks in this sentence:


I am 90-100% confident that I will [insert habit] for [insert how much/how often] after I [habit to piggyback on] for the next 7 days

The first step is to scale the habit to something you are 90-100% confident you can do. 

You might want to track specific meals (just breakfasts, lunches, or dinners), or specific days (mondays, wednesdays, fridays). 

Point it, whatever you pick, it should be as easy as brushing your teeth. 

When Am I Going To Do The Habit?
You should plan to track what you eat right after a habit you already. So if you are going to track what you eat during dinner, finishing your dinner might be a good trigger to remind you to track what you just ate. 

Post Your Personal Version of The Habit!

Go to the Habitry app and post your personal version of the habit. 

Here’s a template:

I am 90-100% confident that I will track what I eat by [insert how] after I [insert piggyback habit] for [insert how many days this week].

Here’s an example:

I am 90-100% confident that I will track what I eat by writing down what I eat at dinner in my journal after I am done eating dinner, for 4 out of 7 days this week.

P.S. Don’t worry about making it perfect. We can always help you scale the habit to fit your life. In fact, that’s the whole point of coaching!
