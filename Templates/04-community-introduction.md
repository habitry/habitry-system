##Email #3: Community Introduction

SUBJECT: Welcome to (Insert Name of Habitry Coaching Group. E.g., Rockstar Fatloss Coaching Group)!

Your to-do list for today:

1. Go to (Insert Communication Platform. E.g, Facebook Group, Habitry Platform, etc) and request to join (don't worry, we'll approve you)
2. Introduce yourself in a post and join the discussion.

Today is going to be mainly about logistics. We are going to start on the first habit tomorrow, but today is about laying the groundwork on two of the most important things we’ll be focusing on as we move forward: Community and Consistency.

What you can expect from us: daily accountability from an expert coach and weekly emails with feedback about how things are going.

What we expect from you:
- Endeavor to practice the current habit daily (more on this tomorrow).
- Check-in daily via the threads that will be started to let us know if you did the habit (this is how we can keep track of your progress).
- Respond to the daily reflection questions we leave on the check-in threads.
- Reach out daily to other community members.

Checking in and responding to the reflection questions are important for your own journey - they help to reinforce the consistency needed to make each habit an actual habit! 

Additionally, reaching out to your teammates is important because it helps to foster the spirit of support and encouragement that is crucial for success. Some days we rock it, and some days we struggle a bit. Knowing that you have a core group of teammates (in addition to your coaches!) that are there for you regardless of how the day went can make the low days seem better, and the good days seem even more badass!
 
If you have any questions, feel free to post them in the group. Trust us, if you have a question, someone else has the same question. So ask away!
