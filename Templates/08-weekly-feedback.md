###[Scenario: Client concordance was great]

Hi Daniel,

Just wanted to do your weekly check-in with you after reviewing your data from the past week for Habit #2. 

Let's review your weekly metrics.

Habit engagement rate (did you track your meals?): 26 out of 28 meals (93%)

Hell yeah! Way to go, man! This is an EXCELLENT start to the program! [Specific and positive feedback]

Let’s keep building momentum in the coming week! What can we do to help you get to 27 out of 28 meals next week? :) 

[Focusing him back on process]

To your aesthetics,

Omar

[Scenario: Client is concordance is poor]
In this situation, it’s best to get a team mate to send a message for us. Simple and short is best.
“Hey Omar, can you let V know we miss her and tell her about the new habit?”
