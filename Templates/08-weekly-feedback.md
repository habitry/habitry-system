##Post #2: Weekly Individual Messages 

**Note:** We send a weekly message to each client reviewing how did they did in the past week. Used to keep them moving forward and provides an opportunity to ask for support.

Hi [ClientName],

Weekly check-in time! It seems like you did the protein habit 6 out of 7 days last week. Does that seem accurate? :)

Based on your comments over the past week, it seems like you’ve really leveled-up your mindset and self-awareness. It’s really, really great to see how you’re “doing” fat loss as a fun game and reflecting how to make tiny improvements everyday. [Specific and positive feedback]

Let’s keep building momentum in the coming week! What can we do to help you this week? :) [Focusing client back on process]
