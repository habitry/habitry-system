##Welcome

We’re stoked you’ve decided to become a Habitry Pro! If you're anything like us, you became a coach to help people make real and permanent changes in their life. But let's be honest: coaching is hard. That’s why we created the Habitry Coaching Platform. To make coaching easier for coaches, and better for clients. If there’s one way to sum up the philosophy behind the world’s best coaching platform, it's this:

####**Habits** are hard. **We** make them easy.

Habits are hard because people try to build them alone. Habitry is a solution for building new habits by building them together. The Habitry Coaching Platform is designed using best practices from psychological science. And everything we've learned in the trenches by coaching thousands of clients, with dozens of coaches, over the past 5+ years. All in a beautiful, easy-to-use package. The result? You can help more clients become the best version of themselves, with less work. And clients feel like all the momentum in the world is on their side. 

In this short guide, we’ll show you the exact steps you can follow coach your Habitry Group through their first habit, and beyond. 

We can’t wait to see you create lasting change for your clients.

Head of Coaching Success, Habitry

##The Habitry Method: Big Picture View

There are three simple steps to the Habitry Method:

1. Pick a habit to work on, together.
2. Do it, together.
3. Talk about it, together.

That’s the big picture. We’ll walk you through the details in a bit. But first, let’s get your group ready so you can invite clients. 

##Preparing to Coach Your First Habit

Before we invite clients into your group, you’ll want to take care of two things:

1. Get clients excited about Habitry and preview what they can expect (We’ll show how).
2. Load the habit (at minimum, 48 hours before your group start date).

Okay, let’s go through each of those steps now.

###1. Get clients excited about Habitry

Getting clients excited about Habitry is easy. We’ll use two messages. I explain what they are below. After the explanation, you’ll find a template for each message that you can use. You can deliver these messages in-person, email, text, or whatever medium you feel is appropriate. The templates are formatted for emails. 

**The first message is to be sent right after they sign-up.** The purpose of the message is to induct them into the group, to build their anticipation by giving them a preview of what the group will be like, and to tell them how a Habitry Group is better and different from other types of coaching groups. Usually, you’ll give this message the workweek before your group start date, assuming your group starts on a Monday. 

Here is an template you can use:

>SUBJECT: [Insert Name of your Habitry Coaching Group. E.g., “Rockstar Fat Loss Coaching Group”] Begins Monday!

>Hey [Name], congratulations! You’re now officially a [Insert Group Name. E.g., "Fat Loss Rockstar"]! Over the coming months (or however long you need), we’re going to use the power of community support and habits to help you build a sustainable fat loss lifestyle. 

>On Sunday, I’ll send out an email inviting you to the Habitry app where all the magic will happen.

>But before we get started, I wanted to go over what you can expect from [Insert Name of Habitry Coaching Group. E.g., “Rockstar Fat Loss Coaching Group”] and you should NOT expect:

>The [Insert Name of Habitry Coaching Group. E.g., “Rockstar Fat Loss Coaching Group”] is NOT a “rapid fat loss” or meal-based program. We’ll be working on one habit at a time, which you’ll master with all the other [Insert Group Name. E.g., “Fat Loss Rockstars”]. 

>The community is where all the magic happens. It’s where you’ll get the most experience learning about how to actually make these habits work for your life. And where you’ll be meeting the other [Insert Group Name. E.g., Fat Loss Rockstars] on the same journey as you.

>As promised, the [Insert Name of Habitry Coaching Group. E.g., “Rockstar Fat Loss Coaching Group”] will be unlike any fat loss program out there. As [Insert Group Name. E.g., “Fat Loss Rockstars”], you can expect unlimited and unconditional support from me. So never hesitate to reach out!

>– Coach Name

**The second message is to be sent the day before the group starts.** The purpose of this email is to get them to introduce themselves to their group and how to use the Habitry Group for success.

Here’s a template you can use:

>SUBJECT: Welcome to [Insert Name of Habitry Coaching Group. E.g., “Rockstar Fat Loss Coaching Group”]!
Your to-do list for today:
1. Read this email
2. Go to the Habitry app and introduce yourself in the welcome post
Today is going to be mainly about logistics. We are going to start on the first habit tomorrow, but today is about laying the groundwork on two of the most important things we’ll be focusing on as we move forward: Community and Consistency.
What you can expect from us: daily accountability from an expert coach and weekly personal check-ins to get your feedback on how things are going.

>What we expect from you:

>A. Endeavor to practice the current habit daily (more on this tomorrow).
>B. Check-in daily via the threads that will be started to let us know if you did the habit (this is how we can keep track of >your progress).
>C. Respond to the daily reflection questions we leave on the check-in threads.
>D. Reach out daily to other community members.

>That being said, a big reason why Habitry Groups work is because everything is optional. So, aim to do these things everyday, but don’t make them a homework assignment. 

>Checking in and responding to the reflection questions are important for your own journey.  They help to reinforce the consistency needed to make each habit an actual habit.

>Additionally, reaching out to your teammates is important because it helps to foster the spirit of support and encouragement that is crucial for success. Some days we rock it, and some days we struggle a bit. Knowing that you have a core group of teammates (in addition to your coaches!) that are there for you regardless of how the day went can make the low days seem better, and the good days seem even more badass! 

>Ready to join your team? You’re just three steps away:

>1. Go to http://habitry.com/download to download and install the Habitry app.
>2. When the Habitry app asks you to input your code, use this: [CLIENT’S CODE]
>3. Introduce yourself in the welcome post in the app and join the discussion!

>If you’re using iOS 9, you may get an “Untrusted Enterprise Developer” alert when opening Habitry. It’s totally normal: Apple does this for apps that aren’t in the App Store yet (Habitry is in the process of applying). If you see this pop-up, go to Settings >> General >> Device Management (or, if you're using 9.1 or earlier, go to Settings >> General >> Profile) to >add Habitry as a trusted developer. 

>Finally, if you have any questions, feel free to post them in the group. Trust us, if you have a question, someone else has the same question. So ask away!

>– Coach Name

###2. Load the habit

Let’s take 15 minutes to walk you through setting up an example Food Tracking habit on the Habitry Coaching Platform.

If you want to use a different habit, you can write your own using the steps provided below. Or you can use one of the 24 habits in the Habitry Starter Kit. Just email me and I’ll send it to you.

Make sure you have a habit set up in the app at least 48 hours before your group starts.

1. Go to the Habitry Coaching Platform, tap on “Habits” at the bottom, then tap on the pen icon in the upper right corner.

2. The Habitry Coaching Platform will ask you, “What is the habit?” Provide a label for the habit. 

For example: “I will track what I eat.”

3. You’ll now be back on the Habits screen. Tap on “I will track what I eat.”

4. Select a start date. We recommend the upcoming Monday.

5. Fill out the “Why” section. 

Provide one or two reasons to clients about why they should practice the habit. Think tweet-length. 

For example: “Getting a really good picture of what you’re eating now, day to day, is going to be a great starting place for what we do. The most important step in change is to create awareness.”

6. Fill out the “How can I scale this habit?” section.

Provide an example or two to your clients on how they can make practicing the habit as easy as possible for them.

For example: “One of the most important things for you to succeed in [insert name of your Habitry coaching group] is tailoring each habit to you. 

For this habit, and every other habit that you’ll do, we’ll tailor it by asking you to fill in the blanks in this sentence: 

I am 90-100% confident that I will [insert habit] for [insert how much/how often] after I [habit to piggyback on] for the next 7 days. 

The first step is to scale the habit to something you are 90-100% confident you can do. 

You might want to track specific meals (just breakfasts, lunches, or dinners), or specific days (Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays). 

This is very important: whatever you pick, it should be as easy as brushing your teeth.

7. Fill out the “What can I piggyback off of?” section.

Provide directions on how clients can create a trigger for the habit. 

For example: “You should plan to track what you eat right after a habit you already. So if you are going to track what you eat during dinner, finishing your dinner might be a good trigger to remind you to track what you just ate.”

You just finished loading a “I will track what I eat” habit into the Habitry Coaching Platform for your clients!

Now you just need to do one more task and you’ll be ready to invite clients into your Habitry Group.

###Suggested Posting Schedule for Your First Habit

We suggest you coach your group with a habit lasting two weeks. Below is a suggested posting schedule for your first habit. 

Coach tasks are highlighted in gold. Client tasks are highlighted in blue.

**If this feels like a lot, don’t worry, it’s actually not.** After coaching thousands of people and helping dozens of coaches, we’ve seen everything, so we have templates for everything. We’ll get into those later in the guide. For now, I just wanted to give you an idea of what the suggested posting schedule looks like for a two week habit. 

**Morning posts will typically come from you.** These aren’t blog posts. Think two-three sentences and an open-ended question to start a group discussion. Then your clients (your selected team leaders) will post check-in threads in the evening time. 

**I recommend checking on your group only twice a day.** Once in the morning and once in the evening, for 20-45 minutes. Anymore won’t be noticed by your clients. And it will also help your sanity :)
