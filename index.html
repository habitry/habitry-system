<a id="welcome-to-habitry-source" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-habitry-source" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to the Habitry Source.</h3>

<p>Habitry started out as the Health Psychology research of Steven M. Ledbetter, aka <a href="http://coachstevo.com" target="_blank">Coach Stevo</a>, and then the became the basis of his practice as a coach. Since 2011, 36 cohorts with more than 500 clients have seen iterations of the Habitry System. But it was when Stevo started teaching it to more coaches that the pace of learning skyrocketed.</p>

<a id="open-system" class="anchor" href="#open-system" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>An Open System for Change</h3>

<p>The mission of <a href="http://habitry.com" target="_blank">Habitry, Co.</a> is to "help the most people help the most people." We believe the fastest way to get evidence-based behavior change to the broadest popultion is to open up the process of systematizing it. So Habitry, Co. has licenced these core teaching materials under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International</a>. That means you can use all or part of this system to train your own clients, as long as you follow the rules of attribution. Mainly, if you are using Habitry, please say it's Habitry. If you are only using part of the system, you cannot call it "Habitry."</p>

<p>If you would like to learn more about what "Creative Commons" and "Open Source" means, here's a handy YouTube Video to explain it with Legos.</p>

<a id="using-the-system" class="anchor" href="#using-the-system" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using the System</h3>

<p>What you'll see when you download the Habitry Source, is a living set of documents. The main document is a Tutorial on what Habitry is, why it works so well, and how you can implement it yourself. There are also supporting documents like templates for communicating with clients, research reviews on the foundational theories of Habitry, and the principles that flow from these theories and support all the iterations that make Habitry great. There is also an FAQ.</p>

<p>The Habitry Authors are constantly updating Habitry Source. It is not like a book, but more like a piece of software that is updated every time we learn about a bug or develop a new feature. We let users know about updates with regular emails, but if you want to be on the cutting edge we highly suggest becoming a Habitry Author.</p>
